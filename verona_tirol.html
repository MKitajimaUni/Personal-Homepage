    <h1> Verona and South Tirol</h1>

    <p> This was my very first trip to Italy. <br>
        I am really surprised that the food is much tastier than I expected.
        <br>They were also affordable, and I could sense some sort of "freshness" from the foods, which I could rarely
        feel from the cuisine of other countries, even Japan.</p>

    <p> This Cappuccino cost only around 1.8â‚¬ if I remembered correctly.
        <br>The taste was relatively light, but the fragrance and the taste of the coffee was never weak.</p>

    <h1> Verona and South Tirol</h1>

    <p> This was my very first trip to Italy. <br>
        I am really surprised that the food is much tastier than I expected.
        <br>They were also affordable, and I could sense some sort of "freshness" from the foods, which I could rarely
        feel from the cuisine of other countries, even Japan.</p>

    <h2> What I Ate</h2>

    <p> This Cappuccino cost only around 1.8â‚¬ if I remembered correctly.
        <br>The taste was relatively light, but the fragrance and the taste of the coffee was never weak.</p>

    <p> That was one of the best pizzas I've ever eaten.
        <br> Aperol soda had a really complex flavor consisting of bitter citrus and herbs.
        <br> I think they are perfect for summer drinks, but not with pizzas.

    </figure>
    <p> This tagliatelle was also good.
        <br> The thing I like is that we can usually get free cheese for pasta and bread in almost every restaurant.
        <br> The lemonade was also tasty. I wanted to buy exact same one in the supermarket, but I couldn't find it.</p>

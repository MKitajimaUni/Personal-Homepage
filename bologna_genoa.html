    <h2> Bologna </h2>
    <p>Bologna is the capital of the Emilia-Romagna region in Italy.
        <br>Bologna is known as student city
        and also the birthplace of foods like bolognese (sauce) and lasagna.</p>

            Export</a></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Surprisingly, this margarita costs only 6€!
        <br>This pizzeria is located in near of the main station.
        The taste of the pizza was simple and good, with a sourness of the tomato sauce.
        The price of the foods and drinks are very affordable.
        I ordered a pizza, beer, and espresso.
        Then, It costs only about 9€ in total!</p>

        <figcaption>Cornetto with Pistachio Cream<br>&#128205; In old town of bologna</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>I decided to try this café because I found the queue of the people on the street.
        The café had a good atmosphere, and the taste of cornetto was worth for the waiting time.
        <br> Unlike traditional cornetto with powdered sugar on top, this one had a crystal sugar on top.
        The crystal sugar added a good accent of the texture.
        Yet it is not traditional, I actually liked it very much. </p>

        <figcaption>Tigelle <br>&#128205;<a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/fbvM8PrTrBvvwvhEA"> Tigellino</a></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Tigelle is traditional bread of an Emilia-Romagna region.
        It is usually tiny and has a rounded shape, and filled and served with toppings like cheese and ham.
        <br> I ate the one with mortadella (traditional ham from Bologna) and caprese.
        Both were great in taste, and was very light, and tigelle was slightly crispy.
        <br>Two pieces were actually not enough.
        Tigelle is much smaller than you think!
        If you want to eat this as a lunch, I suggest that you order at least three of them.</p>

            Murtadela</a></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>It is more like Mortadella with bread on top...
        <br> But anyway, this sandwitch was really great and tasty.
        If you want to eat a bunch of mortadella, this is the best for you.
        This shop also opens until late night, so you can get this one after the supermarkets are closed. </p>

    <h2> Genoa </h2>
    <p>Genoa is one of the biggest coastal cities in northern Italy.
        <br>Yet it is not so famous as a touristic city, Genoa is the birthplace of really famous food: pesto sauce!
        <br> In Genoa, pesto is usually served with trofie, short twisted pasta. </p>
    <figure>
        <img src="pics/genoa_pesto.png" alt="Pesto">
        <figcaption> Trofie al pesto <br>&#128205;<a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/1cJEno9fwSCRGEDYA"> Pastificio
            Artigianale di Canneto</a></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>"Pastificio" in Italian stands for the shop that sells pasta or pasta factory.
        That means this place is not a restaurant but more like a homemade pasta shop that can also eat pasta.
        <br> Inside the shop was small, but the price of pasta was really affordable and the taste was magnificent.
        Medium size of trofie costs only about 8€.
        <br> The pesto sauce has a strong taste of onion and good flavor of the ingredients.
        Trofie was one of the best ones I've ever eaten.
        I want to visit there again, and next time, I would buy pasta from the shop.

        <figcaption>Espresso with Cream on top<br>&#128205; In old town of genoa</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>I usually walk a lot when I'm sightseeing the city.
    I needed a little break, and I found the caffe in old town with delicious looking coffee with whipped cream.
    <br> I don't know whai is it called in Italy, but this one was sweet and had good bitterness of espresso.
    <br> It is good to take a short break when you get tired of walking.</p>
